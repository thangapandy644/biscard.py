1. **Imports and Setup:**
   - The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `streamlit`, `mysql.connector`, `PIL`, `cv2`, `os`, `matplotlib`, `re`, and `easyocr`.
   - The code defines the selected options using Streamlit's `selectbox`.

2. **Home Page and Navigation:**
   - Depending on the user's choice from the selection, the code displays different content. If the user selects "Home," a welcome message is displayed.
   - Similarly, for "Upload & Extract" and "Modify" options, relevant content is displayed.

3. **Database Connection:**
   - A connection is established to a MySQL database with the specified credentials.

4. **Styling and UI:**
   - Streamlit markdown is used to apply a background image to the app's layout.
   - The app title is displayed along with a file uploader widget for uploading business card images.

5. **Business Card Extraction:**
   - If the user uploads an image and clicks "Extract Information," the image is read using OpenCV, displayed on the app, and OCR is performed using the `easyocr` library.
   - The extracted text is inserted into the MySQL database using an SQL INSERT query.
   - A success message is displayed upon successful insertion.

6. **Viewing Business Card Data:**
   - If the user selects "View," the app fetches all stored business card data from the database and displays it in a Pandas DataFrame.

7. **Updating Business Card Data (Partial Implementation):**
   - If the user selects "Update," the app displays a dropdown menu to select a business card to update.
   - It shows the current information of the selected business card and allows the user to input new information.
   - A button (commented out) is provided to trigger the update process. However, the update functionality itself is not implemented in the code.

8. **Deleting Business Card Data:**
   - If the user selects "Delete," the app displays a dropdown menu to select a business card to delete.
   - It shows the name of the selected card and provides a button to confirm the deletion.
   - If the deletion is confirmed, the business card information is deleted from the database.

9. **Closing Remarks:**
   - The app ends with a closing caption indicating who created it.

Please note that while the code provides the structure for various operations like extraction, viewing, updating, and deleting business card data, some parts of the implementation are commented out or incomplete (as indicated in the comments). You may need to complete the code, especially the update functionality, to make the app fully functional.
